# FMCG-Shopper-Analytics-Unveiling-Customer-Trends

## Introduction
In the fast-paced and highly competitive world of Fast-Moving Consumer Goods (FMCG), understanding customer behavior is crucial for businesses aiming to stay ahead of the curve. The project, "FMCG Shopper Analytics: Unveiling Customer Trends," delves into the intricacies of customer interactions within hypermarkets, aiming to provide actionable insights that can drive strategic decisions.

This project leverages advanced data science techniques to analyze vast amounts of customer data, including purchase patterns, preferences, and demographics. By employing methods such as clustering, regression analysis, and predictive modeling, we seek to uncover hidden patterns and trends that can inform marketing strategies, inventory management, and overall business operations.

## Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning (STP)
The fundamental marketing framework, STP has been followed here. STP or Segmentation, Targeting and Positioning framework can be applied to all areas of business and marketing activities.

This is a B2C (Business-to-customer) project ie; clients of our business and individuals rather than organizations. The advantage of a B2C model in terms of data science is that we have much more data points.

### 1) Segmentation
* The process of dividing a population of customers into groups that share similar characteristics
* Observations within the same group would have comparable purchasing behavior
* Observations within the same group would respond similarly to different marketing activities
### 2) Targeting
* The process of evaluating potential profits from each segment and deciding which segments to focus on
* Selecting ways to promote your products. You can **target** one segment on TV and another online
* Examining customers' perception. (Involves psychology and usually budget constraints)
### 3) Positioning
* What product characteristics do the custoners from a certain segment need?
* Shows how a product should be **presented** to the customers and through what **channel**
* In fact, this process is so important, that it has a framework of its own called **Marketing Mix**

## Marketing Mix (a Positioning framework)
* Develop the best product or service and offer it at the right price through the right channels
* A typical categorisation of sales promotions, also known as merchandising, is: price reduction, display and feature

## Price Elasticity
* Price elasticity is the percentage change in an economic outcome of interest with respect to one percentage change in a respective price
* It is expected that the units sold from a brand would increase if the unit price of the brand decreases and would increase if the unit price of a competitor brand increases

## Purchase Analytics
* Purchase probability
* Probability for brand choice
* Purchase quantity
